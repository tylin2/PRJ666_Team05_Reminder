AND DON'T LET THE TEAM KNOW BEFORE MERGE YOUR WORK INTO THE MAIN BRANCH.

#### For sub-branch, use the meaningful name indicating what the branch is for

## Project Description
In this project, a website tailored for people to manage time and keep track of their projects and tasks. The website will help users to track and manage the projects and schedules by creating task lists and schedules. The two most important parts are the task selection and the project, which will be discussed below:

### Task
The task selection will allow users to add a single task and set a notification. In addition, it can send detailed information to other users.

### Project
The project selection will allow users to a project which includes many tasks. In addition, it can send detailed information to other users by tasks.

Please note that both of these require the website to have an authentication system.
